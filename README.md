# Nefertiti
**Generative Art Project, Processing**<br>

**1. Nefertiti in the Modern World**:<br>

The project aims to represent the symbiosis between Ancient Egyptian culture and Pop Art style in an interactive way, using the face of Nefertiti as a symbol of natural and perfect beauty. The presentation offers a comprehensive overview of the concept and the historical references behind the project.
It also showcases the realization of a smooth transition between phases of construction and destruction, utilizing key generative art principles: randomness, iteration, and recursion.
